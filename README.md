# Ignite Feed

Ignite Feed was a challenge developed during the Ignite Course, a [@Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) course focused on practicing the foundations of React (such as Components, States, Immutability and Hooks). TypeScript was a new tool for me and now it'll definitely come in handy for my next projects.
